# Public status — GXFP51A0 / ST411 fingerprint driver

**Default:** [rel71.30 recommended preview](https://github.com/GodsQuantum/Huawei-Matebook-13-Linux/releases/tag/matebook13-rel71.30).

**Last fully cold-boot/deep-S3 validated rollback:** [rel71.24](docs/validated-checkpoint-71.24.md).

On the reference MateBook 13, rel71.30 completed enrollment using the **native KDE graphical interface**; eight observed verification captures passed at the unchanged threshold 7. A separate wrong-finger control rejected an unenrolled finger (scores 2, 3, 4) before the enrolled right index succeeded (16). These are **single-machine results**, not a population-level false-acceptance measurement.

Ubuntu 24.04/26.04 source builds pass; Ubuntu 26.04.1 native build and fprintd ABI compatibility also pass. A real Ubuntu fingerprint unlock and MX250 GPU test have **not** yet been completed. Cold-boot/deep-S3 testing of rel71.30 and testing on an independent GXFP51A0 device remain open.

There is no firmware flashing, automatic enrollment, or redistribution of fingerprint templates or machine-specific keys. Internal personal handoffs and development materials are excluded from the public repository.
